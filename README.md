This project contains a series of SQL queries designed to analyze and extract insights from a fictional music store database. The queries cover multiple scenarios such as customer behavior, sales analysis, artist performance, and genre popularity.

## Project Overview
The project is structured into three question sets, each targeting specific analytical objectives:

### Question Set 1
1. Identify the senior-most employee based on job title.
2. Find countries with the most invoices.
3. Retrieve the top 3 total invoice amounts.
4. Determine the city generating the highest revenue to host a promotional event.
5. Identify the best customer based on total spending.

### Question Set 2
